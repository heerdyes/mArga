upon any language, create
  - turtle (tu[c|g|e|l])
  - shell (sh[c|g|e|l])
  - editor (ed[c|g|e|l])
  - file explorer (fx[c|g|e|l])
  - network explorer (nx[c|g|e|l])
  - terminal emulator (te[c|g|e|l])
  - web browser (wb[c|g|e|l])
  - web server (ws[c|g|e|l])
  - window manager (wm[c|g|e|l])
  - virtual machine (vm[c|g|e|l])
    - eventually implement mArga on this! (fractal automata manifest!)
  - operating system (os[c|g|e|l])
    - megaproject!
    - possibly use vm[c|g|e|l] as target
  - media player (mp[c|g|e|l])
  - flow based programming environment (fb[c|g|e|l])
  - file system (fs[c|g|e|l])
  - database (db[c|g|e|l])
  - cad (cad[c|g|e|l])
  - mArga installer (mi[c|g|e|l])
    - utility to setup the mArga software suite üòÅ

aspects
  - console (basic)
    - terminal based wizard (prompt) style
  - graphic (advanced)
    - event based gui to express program intent
  - embedded (advanced / custom-iodev)
    - h/w + s/w to build a system that expresses the program intent
  - language (advanced)
    - invent a language (dsl?) that expresses the program intent
    - or a configuration dsl that generalizes program intent

incarnations
  - concept of incremental versions does not resonate
  - i like to sketch software (the elusive philosophy of "feel")
  - phonemes using Harvard-Kyoto ASCII scheme
  - these could represent almost all consonants and vowels of the devanagari script
  - but it presumes case sensitivity; which is a good thing
  - but that makes one think of windows systems! we can afford to risk this.

eventually the shell becomes a language interface to "custom programs" such as
the editor, file explorer, and so on.
from the virtual machine(s) emerge compiler/interpreter toolchain ecosystems.
eventually the fractal recursion continues ad infinitum.
