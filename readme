upon any language, create
  - shell (sh[c|g|e][0-9][0-9])
  - editor (ed[c|g|e][0-9][0-9])
  - file explorer (fx[c|g|e][0-9][0-9])
  - program launcher (pl[c|g|e][0-9][0-9])
  - network explorer (nx[c|g|e][0-9][0-9])

aspects
  - console (basic)
  - graphic (advanced)
  - embedded (advanced / custom-iodev)

eventually the shell becomes a language interface to "custom programs" such as
the editor, file explorer, and so on.
the shell evolves into a full-fledged language,
and the fractal recursion continues ad infinitum
