upon any language, create
  - turtle (tu[c|g|e])
  - shell (sh[c|g|e])
  - editor (ed[c|g|e])
  - file explorer (fx[c|g|e])
  - program launcher (pl[c|g|e])
  - network explorer (nx[c|g|e])
  - virtual machine (vm[c|g|e])
    - eventually implement mArga on this! (fractal automata manifest!)

aspects
  - console (basic)
  - graphic (advanced)
  - embedded (advanced / custom-iodev)
  
incarnations
  - concept of versions does not resonate
  - i like to sketch software
  - 2 letter subdirectories (regex [a-za-z]) using Harvard-Kyoto ASCII scheme
  - these could represent almost all consonants and vowels of the devanagari script
  - but it presumes case sensitivity; which is probably a good thing
  - but that makes one think of windows systems!

eventually the shell becomes a language interface to "custom programs" such as
the editor, file explorer, and so on.
the shell evolves into a full-fledged language,
and the fractal recursion continues ad infinitum
